He made his fortune as the co-founder of Microsoft and has since become a major investor and philanthropist.</p>\\n<p>With a net worth of $89 billion, you would think that Tech mogul Bill Gates would have one private jet for each day of the week. Instead, he chose a modest $40 million Bombardier BD-700 Global Express and equipped it with millions of dollars in gadgets and innovations – because, well…he happens to be a money-smart businessman.

From a bank account that is clearly bursting at the seams to a $3.6-million Gulfstream IV, Enrique is apparently living it up. To top things off, the singer is a certified pilot – which seems like an effort to see that his money does not lay idle.

In addition to playing himself in the iconic American sitcom, <em>Seinfeld, </em>Jerry has dabbled in acting, producing, and directing – all of which have been instrumental in building his portfolio and stuffing his bank account. So when the comic icon wanted to splurge on a $22-million Gulfstream V, he certainly didn’t need a financial advisor to direct his affairs.

The vessel provides room for 21 guests, and there’s a gym, theater, Jacuzzi, lounge bar, jet skis, and water sports equipment.

Gomez may not have garnered enough in earnings to afford her own private jet, but a star of her status cannot mortgage her comfort on account of cost – so Gomez flies around in a luxurious private plane she rents at $250K per month.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>BONO &#8211; <em>Kingdom Come</em>, Estimated $22 Million</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32550\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BONO.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BONO.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BONO-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Anyone who loves music knows the name Bono.

Considering the cost of divorce lawyers and tons of therapeutic luxury shopping that often accompanies such high profile splits, we are glad our girl still keeps her head above water. That said, with Mariah being single again, her $40-million Gulfstream Jet can once again be put to business-related use.

With her unique style and powerful voice, Rihanna has become one of the most popular singers of our time.</p>\\n<p>She can afford a lot more than she is letting on. But rather than buying a private jet, the singer chose a more unconventional means of investment and rented a Boeing 777 when she was going on tour. The plane came quite handy for transporting herself and her entourage – but considering how much money she had spent renting, it leaves the question if renting really gives you your money’s worth.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Chris Brown &#8211; Gulfstream IV, Estimated $110K Per Round Trip</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32558\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chris-Brown.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chris-Brown.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chris-Brown-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>We seem to have lost Chris Brown in a haze of domestic abuse charges and alleged drug and alcohol addiction – yet somehow, the singer manages to still keep his head above water, even living quite lavishly, at mild risk of bankruptcy. Brown’s aircraft is a Gulfstream IV estimated to cost about $110K per round trip. If he’s spending that kind of money a few years after releasing a major hit, it is safe to say that being a singer, actor, and songwriter is either very lucrative – or Chris is smart enough to keep a small stash of his earnings in a savings account.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1 class=\\\"r\\\"><strong>Celine Dion &#8211; </strong>Bombardier Global Express, Estimated $42 Million</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32552\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Celine-Dion.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Celine-Dion.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Celine-Dion-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Celine Dion is a singer, actor, and songwriter from Canada.

Well, think again. The famous singer appears to have revamped her business plan and splurged on a $42-million luxury jet to get her around.

For one, she doesn’t own a luxury jet but flies around in a small Cirrus SR22 that can only hold four or five people tops. And with her pilot&#8217;s license, it seems like the perfect investment to ensure that her flying doesn’t get too rusty.

And after directing the movie <em>Jaws, </em>his love for the sea lingered. Spielberg bought a 282 feet yacht dubbed the <em>Seven Seas</em>, which might eventually prove to be a smart investment if he ever needs to film on the high sea. Meanwhile, it looks like the yacht is money well spent since it can host up to 12 people and holds a helipad, spa, gym, infinity pool, and cinema.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1><strong>Tom Cruise &#8211; Gulfstream</strong> <strong>IV, Estimated $36 Million</strong></h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32568\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tom-Cruise.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tom-Cruise.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tom-Cruise-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Tom Cruise is an award-winning American actor and director best known for starring as secret agent Ethan Hunt in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> film series.

The ship has room for eight guests and a 4-man crew, and has an eccentric touch, much like the fashion designer. And where money is no object, it isn’t too surprising to see him transcend the conventional.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Steven Spielberg &#8211; Bombardier Global Express XRS, Estimated $42 Million</h1>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32605\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Steven-Spielberg-jet.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Steven-Spielberg-jet.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Steven-Spielberg-jet-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Steven Spielberg is known as one of the most successful filmmakers and has directed some of the most popular movies. From Jaws and ET the Extra-Terrestrial to Schindler’s List and Lincoln, Spielberg has a long list of unforgettable hits to his name.</p>\\n<p>When he is not sailing around on The Seven Seas, Steven takes flight in his $42-million Bombardier Global Express XRS. Between the yacht and his aircraft, he is spending quite some money on transportation alone. But considering his schedule as a world-class director and how much his earnings are, we have to agree that it is a worthwhile investment. A $3.7-billion net worth is surely no joke.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">\",\"</p>\\n<h1><strong>John Travolta – Boeing 707, Estimated $4.5 Million</strong></h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32549\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Travolta-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Travolta-1.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Travolta-1-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>John Travolta is a man of many talents – and acting merely scratches the surface. When he is not delivering a stellar on-screen performance, the actor spends his time flying. That’s right, Travolta is not only an aviation enthusiast but boasts a pilot’s license and has spent a considerable chunk of his earnings on a small collection of aircraft and an airport home in Florida. But aviation and real estate are not his only investments– his decision to donate his Boeing 707 to charity speaks volumes. And we guess that it&#8217;s his own brand of investing in people and relationships.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Tim McGraw &#8211; <strong>Cirrus SR22,</strong><strong> Estimated $650K</strong></h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32600\\\" src=\\\"http://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tim-McGraw.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tim-McGraw.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tim-McGraw-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Whether people know him as Tim McGraw, the country music superstar, or simply by his first name, Samuel, he is without a doubt one of America’s most successful and well-loved singers and actors. He’s also the recipient of three Grammy Awards and 14 Academy of Country Music Awards for his outstanding contributions.</p>\\n<p>Between himself and celebrity wife Faith Hill, whose name is embroidered on the ‘faith’ stick of their customized Cirrus SR22, the couple has enough money to make a less modest choice. However, both Tim and Faith seem to like the prospect of purchasing another property or making a different investment &#8211; and their $650K aircraft is more than adequate.</p>\\n\\n\"],\"title\":\"Take a Look at The Most Jaw-Dropping Celebrity Private Jets &#038; Yachts\",\"date\":\"2023-04-27T10:04:06\"}";

<p>Bill Gates is one of the most famous businessmen in America. He made his fortune as the co-founder of Microsoft and has since become a major investor and philanthropist.</p>
<p>With a net worth of $89 billion, you would think that Tech mogul Bill Gates would have one private jet for each day of the week. Instead, he chose a modest $40 million Bombardier BD-700 Global Express and equipped it with millions of dollars in gadgets and innovations – because, well…he happens to be a money-smart businessman. That said, we should expect the billionaire to go plane shopping pretty soon because a man of his stature cannot have enough private jets.</p>

<h2>Enrique Iglesias – Gulfstream IV,&nbsp;Estimated $3.6 Million</h2><p>Enrique Iglesias is one of the most popular Spanish singers and has entertained audiences worldwide with his passionate music. Although he was born in Spain, Enrique has achieved worldwide success.</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-above-img-section-1"></div><figure class="img-wrapper"><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-left-sidebar-section-1" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1352px;"></div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32559" src="//tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Enrique-Iglesias.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="485" srcset="https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Enrique-Iglesias.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Enrique-Iglesias-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-sidebar-section-1" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1352px;"><div style="position:sticky; top:15px"><div id="ad-top-right-sidebar-section-1" style="margin-bottom:10px;"></div><div id="ad-bottom-right-sidebar-section-1"></div></div></div></figure>

<p>Global heartthrob Iglesias has been on the music scene for quite a while – and being able to belt out beautiful tunes has its many dividends. From a bank account that is clearly bursting at the seams to a $3.6-million Gulfstream IV, Enrique is apparently living it up. To top things off, the singer is a certified pilot – which seems like an effort to see that his money does not lay idle. Talk about a man of many talents!</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-below-content-section-1"><div id="ad-below-content-left-section-1" style="float:left;"></div><div id="ad-below-content-right-section-1" style="float:right;"></div></div>

<p>Considered one of the world’s funniest men, Jerry Seinfeld has carved a unique niche for himself in Hollywood. In addition to playing himself in the iconic American sitcom,&nbsp;<em>Seinfeld,&nbsp;</em>Jerry has dabbled in acting, producing, and directing – all of which have been instrumental in building his portfolio and stuffing his bank account. So when the comic icon wanted to splurge on a $22-million Gulfstream V, he certainly didn’t need a financial advisor to direct his affairs. Well, after more than four decades in the industry, he deserves the luxury.</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-2" id="ad-below-content-section-2"><div id="ad-below-content-left-section-2" style="float:left;"></div><div id="ad-below-content-right-section-2" style="float:right;"></div></div>

<h2>Tiger Woods –&nbsp;<strong><em>Privacy</em>&nbsp;Yacht, Estimated $20 Million</strong></h2><p>When most people think of professional golfers, the first name that comes to mind is most definitely Tiger Woods.

<p>Even though his ex-wife made away with a small chunk of his earnings during their divorce, pro-golfer Tiger Woods clearly held on to a few of his priced properties, including his yacht, which he quite aptly dubbed <em>Privacy</em>. The vessel provides room for 21 guests, and there’s a gym, theater, Jacuzzi, lounge bar, jet skis, and water sports equipment. It should undoubtedly provide him with all the ‘privacy’ he needs.<br>

<h2>Matthew McConaughey –&nbsp;Bombardier Global 7000, Estimated $72.8 Million</h2><p>Matthew McConaughey is an American actor who has starred in some of the biggest and most popular films of recent years. From his breakthrough role in <em>Dazed and Confused</em> to more recent hits such as <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em>. Leading Hollywood Texan McConaughey has been topping charts for as long as we can remember – and our favorite onscreen heartthrob certainly deserves a luxurious life on account of the many times he has delivered heartwarming performances.</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-4" id="ad-above-img-section-4"></div><figure class="img-wrapper"><div class="ad_placeholder section-4" id="ad-left-sidebar-section-4" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1432px;"></div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32554" src="//tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Matthew-McConaughey-2.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="485" srcset="https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Matthew-McConaughey-2.jpg 728w, https://tummytuckhipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Matthew-McConaughey-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><div class="ad_placeholder section-4" id="ad-sidebar-section-4" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1432px;"><div style="position:sticky; top:15px"><div id="ad-top-right-sidebar-section-4" style="margin-bottom:10px;"></div><div id="ad-bottom-right-sidebar-section-4"></div></div></div></figure>
