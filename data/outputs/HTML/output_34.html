According to an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, she doesn&#8217;t smoke or drink while keeping her beauty treatments simple, and it sure is working.</p>\\n<p>Fans saw Lea playing a small part in the hit series The Goldbergs during 2020 while she also starred in Dinner in America while looking great. We&#8217;re also looking forward to her upcoming comedy Mark, Mary &amp; Some Other People, scheduled for a 2021 release.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Demi Moore &#8211; Age 60</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60318\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>When the green-eyed brunette Demi Moore first appeared in the movies, she captivated viewers with more than just her stunning appearance. After all, she was one of the most talented actresses of the &#8217;80s. It&#8217;s no wonder that, by 1996, Moore was getting a record $12.5 million deal to star in an Andrew Bergman movie.</p>\\n<p>From then on, her career never lost its momentum. And neither did her looks. Captivating the attention of the likes of Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher, Moore still looks impressive enough to be called a bombshell.

But to the stunning Erika Eleniak, being among the world&#8217;s hunkiest actors wasn&#8217;t intimidating at all; in fact, it felt natural.</p>\\n<p>Many things have changed in Eleniak&#8217;s life since her Baywatch days. But not the fact that she can feel proud of herself anytime she takes a look at the mirror. Now 50, she continues to work as an actress and has recently appeared in the TV series Desperate Housewives and the movie Boone: The Bounty Hunter.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Jeri Ryan &#8211; Age 55</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60340\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jeri-Ryan.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jeri-Ryan.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jeri-Ryan-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>When she first appeared dressed up as Seven of Nine in Star Trek: Voyager, the stunning actress Jeri Ryan immediately gained the hearts and souls of every sci-fi fan out there.

Just like a Michelangelo Fresco, she&#8217;s a mesmerizing image you cannot look away from. Still acting, she has recently made it to the movie, Devil&#8217;s Revenge, and has appeared in the 2020 reboot of MacGyver.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Pauley Perrette &#8211; Age 53</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60356\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pauley-Perrette.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pauley-Perrette.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pauley-Perrette-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>The &#8220;punk-rocker&#8221; Pauley Perrette doesn&#8217;t have to dress girly to make every man sigh.

Back when the term supermodel was still a novelty, she made it to the group of catwalk idols who banked millions every year due to their worldwide fame and appeal.</p>\\n<p>At the age of 49, Schiffer is now worth an estimated $60 million. In her curriculum, she counts with over 1,000 magazine covers (a world record), numerous collaborations with the world&#8217;s top fashion brands, and a handful of movie appearances.

But while Bill Crosby has lost all of its once-praised comedic charms, the same hasn&#8217;t happened to the woman who played Denise Huxtable.</p>\\n<p>If anything, actress Lisa Bonet has become even more beautiful and powerful-looking. Still working in movies and TV shows, Bonet has continued to steal the show away with her fierce attitude and striking looks.

But no woman has ever made a stronger impression on &#8220;The King&#8221; than Priscilla Presley, his one and only wife. The American actress tied the knot with the legendary rock &amp; roll singer in 1967, and the two divorced only seven years later.</p>\\n<p>Their bond, however, lasted forever. And by the time Elvis died, Priscilla proved to have what it takes to manage the priceless estate of &#8220;The King.&#8221; She worked hard as a businesswoman to transform Graceland into a top tourist attraction, and she did so without never stop taking care of herself.

The beautiful Swedish blonde married her former &#8220;boss&#8221; Tiger Woods in 2004, and the two divorced six years later. The result? Countless headlines in celebrity media and a significant settlement of $100 million.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">From a nanny to a millionaire, Nordegren can&#8217;t complain about how lucky she&#8217;s been. Her divorce process was emotionally consuming and physically tiring, but you wouldn&#8217;t notice it by looking at her. At the age of 40, Nordegren still looks as fresh and gorgeous as your regular 21-years-old model.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">\",\"</p>\\n<h1>Shannon Tweed &#8211; Age 65</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60363\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shannon-Tweed.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shannon-Tweed.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shannon-Tweed-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>The Canadian actress Shannon Tweed has always been a beautiful woman, and she knows it.

But Tweed doesn&#8217;t need to undress at all to make a strong impression.</p>\\n<p>From 2006 to 2012, she showed her true self in the reality-series, Gene Simmons Family Jewels, in which she starred alongside her long-time rock &amp; roll husband Gene Simmons. Now 63 years old, it&#8217;s rumored that Tweed may have had a little help from plastic surgeons to keep her good looks.

She is 52 years old now.</p>\\n<p>According to her Instagram page, she’s been a vegan for quite some time now. It’s safe to say that her diet has played an essential role in her looking decades younger right now. In 2020, we got to see her in an episode of Digital Sky.

Judy’s been married to Tom Niedenfuer since 1987. They’ve even had two children together.

Through it, she shared her versions of traditional recipes from around the world.</span></p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Kate Bush &#8211; Age 64</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60357\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kate-Bush.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kate-Bush.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kate-Bush-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Few women are as beautiful on the outside as Kate Bush, who still looks great at the age of 61. But even though Bush&#8217;s physical attributes are impressive, the singer-songwriter is the kind of woman whose beauty is mostly found on the inside.</p>\\n<p>The first female artist to top the U.K. charts with a self-written song, Bush&#8217;s unique ability to craft emotive pop ballads, is what makes her even more beautiful. We&#8217;re still waiting for the follow-up to 50 Words for Snow, her latest record. In the meantime, we can find all the joy we need by listening to all-time classics such as &#8220;Wuthering Heights&#8221; and &#8220;Running Up That Hill.&#8221;</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Jolene Blalock &#8211; Age 47</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60355\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jolene-Blalock.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jolene-Blalock.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jolene-Blalock-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>There are many beautiful women over 40 out there, but few are as impressive as the gorgeous Jolene Blalock. She will always be remembered for her breakthrough role as Commander T&#8217;Pol in the Star Trek: Enterprise TV series. But she&#8217;s been acting successfully ever since, and she hasn&#8217;t lost a bit of her beauty.</p>\\n<p>Proving that she can only get better and better, Blalock is a gym fanatic, at least judging by her statuesque body and incredibly sharp abs. And believe it or not, this unbelievably fit 45-year-old woman has been a mother on three occasions.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Mia Sara &#8211; Age 55</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61831\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mia-Sara.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mia-Sara.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mia-Sara-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Mia Sara gained mainstream fame as an actress in the late &#8217;80s thanks to the performance she had in the film called Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off. She has always had an enchanting face, and it looks like her beauty never faded as she got older.</p>\\n<p>Aside from an effective skincare routine, she says that wearing a hat helps her stay protected from sun damage. Sara hasn&#8217;t acted in anything since the 2013 short film titled Pretty Pretty, and it looks like she&#8217;s enjoying her quiet time today. She has been happily married to Brian Henson since 2010.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Elisabeth Shue &#8211; Age 59</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60813\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Elisabeth-Shue.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Elisabeth-Shue.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Elisabeth-Shue-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>From The Karate Kid to Back to the Future and Piranha 3D, Elisabeth Shue has proved that her talent is every bit as timeless as her beauty is! She was born in Delaware back in 1963, October. Today she is in her 50s and has never stopped acting.</p>\\n<p>As a matter of fact, in 2020, she played alongside Tom Hanks in the Greyhound film. Elisabeth arguably gets prettier as time goes by. She is worth around $12.5 million right now. She’s been married to Davis Guggenheim since 1994 and has had three children with him.</p>\\n\",\"\\n<h1>Matthew Labyorteaux &#8211; Age 56</h1>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60339\\\" src=\\\"http://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Matthew-Labyorteaux.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" srcset=\\\"https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Matthew-Labyorteaux.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Matthew-Labyorteaux-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Like women, men can also have a hard time getting older. But like the beautiful ladies on our list, the former child actor Matthew Labyorteaux has shown that it&#8217;s possible to keep your good looks after turning 50. You may know him as the young Albert Quinn Ingalls, from Little House on the Prairie, but Labyroteaux has most recently made a name for himself as a voice actor.</p>\\n<p>Besides being a friendly-looking guy, Labyroteaux has many talents that don&#8217;t involve acting. He has competed in professional videogame contests during the &#8217;80s, and he has also proved he has a big heart by founding the Youth Rescue Fund in 1992.</p>\\n\"],\"title\":\"These Celebs Have Aged Flawlessly\",\"date\":\"2023-05-16T07:53:56\"}";

<p>You may remember Lea Thompson from Back to the Future or perhaps a more recent role like starring in Little Women or Over The Hill. Whenever we look at Lea, her look reveals a beautiful natural glow.

<h2>Demi Moore – Age 60</h2><p>When the green-eyed brunette Demi Moore first appeared in the movies, she captivated viewers with more than just her stunning appearance. After all, she was one of the most talented actresses of the ’80s. It’s no wonder that, by 1996, Moore was getting a record $12.5 million&nbsp;deal to star in an Andrew Bergman movie.</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-above-img-section-1"></div><figure class="img-wrapper"><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-left-sidebar-section-1" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1312px;"></div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60318" src="//wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="485" srcset="https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-sidebar-section-1" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1312px;"><div style="position:sticky; top:15px"><div id="ad-top-right-sidebar-section-1" style="margin-bottom:10px;"></div><div id="ad-bottom-right-sidebar-section-1"></div></div></div></figure>
<p></p>

<p>From then on, her career never lost its momentum. And neither did her looks. Captivating the attention of the likes of Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher, Moore still looks impressive enough to be called a bombshell. We never thought that&nbsp;being 57 could ever look this good!</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-1" id="ad-below-content-section-1"><div id="ad-below-content-left-section-1" style="float:left;"></div><div id="ad-below-content-right-section-1" style="float:right;"></div></div>

<h2>Erika Eleniak – Age 53</h2><p>It takes&nbsp;a special lady to rock the red swimsuit in the Baywatch TV series, especially considering people like Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff were also part of the cast. But to the stunning Erika Eleniak, being among the world’s hunkiest actors wasn’t intimidating at all; in fact, it felt natural.</p><div class="ad_placeholder section-2" id="ad-above-img-section-2"></div><figure class="img-wrapper"><div class="ad_placeholder section-2" id="ad-left-sidebar-section-2" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1352px;"></div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60328" src="//wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Erika-Eleniak.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="485" srcset="https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Erika-Eleniak.jpg 728w, https://wordsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Erika-Eleniak-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><div class="ad_placeholder section-2" id="ad-sidebar-section-2" sticky="true" style="min-height: 1352px;"><div style="position:sticky; top:15px"><div id="ad-top-right-sidebar-section-2" style="margin-bottom:10px;"></div><div id="ad-bottom-right-sidebar-section-2"></div></div></div></figure>
